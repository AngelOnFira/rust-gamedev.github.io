Welcome to the 22nd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Airship](veloren.jpg) _The beginning of an exciting journey_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

Veloren's 3rd birthday was at the end of May, on the 25th! During the month,
lots of systems were overhauled. Music changes were made to only play certain
tracks in certain areas. Econsim was optimized, and many bugs were fixed. The
minimap was overhauled, with many quality-of-life and visual improvements.
Terrain compression speed was worked on, with many trials of different
compression techniques.

The large physics overhaul was merged, and lots of patches are being added to
issues that popped up from it. You can see a small flight in action
[here][veloren-glider]. Dungeons have been balanced, and many weapons have also
seen changes. In June, 0.10 will be released.
